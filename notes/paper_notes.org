** Intro
 - Goal: Automated recoloring of images. 
   This is done by analyzing correlations in 
   
   Attempt to modify colors without to much correlation between color axes.

   For this reason, LAB is used - the axes are more independent.

   


** Algorithm
   - Convert to LaB
   - Take mean, sd of L, a, B
   - Sutract means from L, a, B, for target image:
     L* = L - mean(L)
     a* = a - mean(a)
     B* = B - mean(B)

   - Scale by sd ratio:
     
     L' = (sigma(L) / sigma(Lsource)) * L*
     a' = (sigma(a) / sigma(asource)) * a*
     B' = (sigma(B) / sigma(Bsource)) * B*
     
    Now the target datapoints have the same SD's as the source.

  - Add in the source means:
    Lf = L' + mean(Lsource)
    af = a' + mean(af)
    Bf = B' + mean(Bf)
